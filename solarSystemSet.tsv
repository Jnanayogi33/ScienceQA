101201	A large, solid spherical body in the solar system is classified as a moon. Which characteristic of the body gives it this classification?	C	It rotates on its axis.	It lacks liquid water.	It orbits a nearby planet.	It reflects light from a star.
101212	The eight known planets accreted during the formation of our solar system. The four inner planets are rocky and have little or no atmospheres. The four outer planets have very thick atmospheres. Which fact about our early solar system best helps explain how these different planet types formed?	C	The outer planets were too far from the Sun for solar pressure to maintain compressed gases.	The outer planets each absorbed most of the gases from their large number of moons.	The temperature near the Sun was too great for most gases to condense on the inner planets.	The gravitational forces from the outer planets pulled away the gases from the inner planets.
101221	The current structure of the solar system implies which conclusion about its history?	A	The nebular cloud flattened before planetary formation.	Planetary temperatures were much more uniform until recently.	Matter began to revolve around its center after planetary formation.	Nuclear fusion was much more widespread before planetary formation.
101294	Which of the following describes the sun?	C	The sun is a star made up of rocky material.	The sun is a star that is the same size as all the other stars in the sky.	The sun is a star and is the center of our solar system.	The sun is a planet and is the center of our solar system.
101304	As our solar system formed, how did the higher proportion of radioactive elements in the protoplanets influence planetary development?	C	It reinforced the compression caused by gravity.	It powered the motion of planets toward their final orbits.	It provided a heat source to help drive layer differentiation.	It altered the elements so planets would have the same compositions.
101346	Direct observation has shown the Moon's composition is overall similar to Earth's mantle. This similarity has been interpreted as supporting which theory?	D	The Moon formed from the same material as the outer planets.	The Moon formed by the capture of a large asteroid from the asteroid belt.	The Moon formed by splitting off from an Earthlike planet in a similar solar system.	The Moon formed from material ejected during a collision of the early Earth with another planet.
101368	Scientists observed ice as a component of comets. This observation reinforced which model of the history of our solar system?	B	Most planets in our solar system originally had water oceans.	Comets delivered some of the water found in Earth's oceans.	Solar system planetary cores are generally a mix of iron and water.	Most of the water in our solar system migrated to comets over time.
101374	In the solar system, moons orbit planets. Which of these do planets orbit?	A	the Sun	Halley's comet	the asteroid belt	a black hole

101681	Different units of measurement are more useful in some settings than in others. Which unit of measurement is most used when comparing distances within the solar system?	D	the mile	the kilometer	the light year	the astronomical unit

101824	Uranus is one of the outer planets of the solar system. The average distance of Uranus from the Sun is 2.87 billion kilometers. Which best explains why Uranus revolves in its orbit instead of moving out into space?	B	The orbit of Neptune limits Uranus.	Gravity pulls Uranus toward the Sun.	Electromagnetic energy pulls on Uranus.	Other planets have the same mass as Uranus.
101898	Although no other known planet in our solar system can support life as it exists on Earth, there are characteristics that make some planets more suitable than others for supporting artificial environments in which humans could live. Which planet is best suited for an artificial human habitat?	C	Venus, which has an average surface temperature of 864Â°F	Jupiter, which radiates twice as much heat as it absorbs from the Sun	Mars, which possibly has frozen water under the surface	Saturn, which is composed mostly of hydrogen and helium
102061	In the 1500s, Nicolaus Copernicus proposed a new theory on the heliocentric structure of the solar system. Which of these statements best describes this new theory?	C	Earth is at the center of the solar system.	There are eight planets in the solar system.	The Sun is at the center of the solar system.	Moons have circular orbits in the solar system.
102080	Based on the evidence available at the time, early models of the solar system stated that all objects in space orbited Earth. In the 16th century, an astronomer reevaluated the evidence and proposed a model of the solar system that is still in use. What part of this model corrected the mistake in previous solar system models?	A	The Sun is at the center of this model.	Earth is the largest object in this model.	This model contains more than one star.	This model shows that Earth is stationary.
102148	The Heliocentric Theory, as supported by Copernicus, revolutionized scientific theories regarding	C	the life cycle.	the water cycle.	the solar system.	the immune system.
102155	Why are rock samples from the moon helpful in determining the relative age of the solar system?	A	because moon rocks have not gone through changes caused by tectonic activity	because moon rocks have gone through changes caused by tectonic activity	because moon rocks came from a distant solar system	because moon rocks by their nature change over time
